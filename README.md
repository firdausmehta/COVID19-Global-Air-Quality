# Outline
Our study is focused on identifying a correlation between developments in Covid-19 active cases and the changes seen in air quality across the world. We will examine and visualise the air quality against the number of active Covid-19 cases in major cities around the globe, as well as 2 key cities in Australia from 2019 to 2020.

# Hypothesis
We expect to observe a strong, negative correlation between the number of Covid-19 active cases and the level of air quality, with more drastic improvements in air quality during the pandemic.


# Questions
- How do the changes in Australia’s air quality during the pandemic compare to the changes globally in the same time period? Firdaus
- Compare and contrast 5 major cities and their variation in air quality from 2019 to 2020? Chao
- Are the changes in the number of Covid-19 active cases correlated to the changes observed in Australia’s air quality in 2020? Litesh
