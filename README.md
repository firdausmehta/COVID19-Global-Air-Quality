Air quality in our dataset is determined by the median level concentrations of various major air
pollutants, of which we will focus on two:

1. Carbon Monoxide (CO) 
- Colorless/odorless gas
- Originates from vehicle exhaust and burning fossil fuels
- CO concentration measured through Parts Per Million (PPM)

2. Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5)
- Originates from natural sources such as bush fires or mining
- PM2.5 concentration is measured through microgram per cubic metre (Âµg/m3)

We used https://katestone.global/air-quality-covid-19-update2/ and https://learn.kaiterra.com/en/air-academy/how-does-the-laser-egg-measure-pm2.5#:~:text=How%20Is%20PM2.,express%20the%20amount%20of%20PM2. to help narrow this down.
